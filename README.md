# üç≠ Anna‚Äôs Food Adventure

A 2D Unity platformer game created as a fun birthday project!  
Play as **Anna**, a character inspired by my friend, who defends herself against snowguns that shoot broccoli ü•¶ while collecting candies üç¨ and junk food üç© to score Aura points.  

The game evolved from a series of academic Unity assignments into a full, polished **platform-based WebGL game** with physics, sound, animation, and visual effects.
